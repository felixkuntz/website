My name is Felix Kuntz. I am a graduate student in economics at the University of Oxford. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Goethe University Frankfurt (Germany). 

Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I worked as a research assistant at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE in Frankfurt. Moreover, I completed internships at the Deutsche Bundesbank in Frankfurt, the Permanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations in New York City, and the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in Berlin.

My research interests include Macroeconomics, Heterogeneous Agents Macro, and Monetary Policy.
