My name is Felix Kuntz. I am a Doctoral Student in Economics at the University of Oxford and a Research Trainee at the European Central Bank. 

I hold a Master of Philosophy in Economics from the University of Oxford, a Bachelor of Science in Economics, and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Goethe University Frankfurt. 

Prior to joining the University of Oxford and the ECB, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE in Frankfurt. Moreover, I completed internships at the Deutsche Bundesbank in Frankfurt, the Permanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations in New York City, and the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in Berlin.

My research interests are in the field of macroeconomics, in particular monetary policy, financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and fiscal-monetary interactions.
