Central Banks' communication is at the center of macroeconomic policy discussions. Since decades a productive research field is dedicated to the analysis of how central banks communicate their policies to the general public and experts. Reflecting the increasing availability of rich data sources and analytic techniques, the ways of analyzing central bank's communication have developed prolifically. This project is a modest contribution to the understanding of policymakers' communication and a channel to cultivate my passion for economics and data science.

This projects aims to analyze the speeches given by officials of the European Central Bank (ECB) with text mining techniques and visualize interesting aspects in Tableau dashboards. For this project, I use the publicly available speeches dataset of the ECB. 

Data source: European Central Bank. (25 October 2019). Speeches dataset. Retrieved from: [www.ecb.europa.eu](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/html/downloads.en.html).

    <summary>ECB Communication Dashboard: Relative Occurrence of Words</summary>

The dashboard enables to search ECB's communication for certain words. Up to 15 words can be entered in the left column and the graph shows the relative occurrence of these words for each year. The relative occurrence is calculated as the quotient of the number of occurrences of the entered words over the total number of words in the corresponding year abstracting from stop words (i.e., words without meaning).
