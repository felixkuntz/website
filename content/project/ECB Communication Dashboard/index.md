Central Banks' communication is at the center of macroeconomic policy discussions. Since decades a prolific research field is dedicated to way central banks communicate their policies to the general public and experts. Reflecting the increasing availability of rich data sources and analytic techniques, the ways of analyzing central bank's communication have developed prolifically. This project is a modest contribution to the understanding of policymakers' communication and a channel to cultivate my passion for economics and data science.
